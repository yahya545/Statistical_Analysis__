Air Quality Index (AQI) Statistical Analysis Project

Overview
This project performs a detailed statistical analysis of national Air Quality Index (AQI) data, utilizing A/B testing and hypothesis testing techniques. The aim is to provide insights into air quality conditions across various states in the U.S., with specific case studies on Los Angeles County, New York, Ohio, and Michigan.

Key Findings
Los Angeles County vs. Rest of California**:

Conducted a two-sample t-test resulting in a p-value of 0.0498, indicating a statistically significant difference in mean AQI levels.
New York vs. Ohio**:

Utilized a one-tailed t-test with a p-value of 0.0304, suggesting that New York has a lower mean AQI than Ohio.
Michigan AQI Policy Evaluation**:

A one-sample t-test yielded a p-value of 0.9399, indicating that Michigan's mean AQI is not significantly greater than 10, suggesting limited immediate concern for the new policy.
Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
SciPy

Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis includes national AQI measurements by state over time, sourced from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
